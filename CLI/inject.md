## `inject`
This command can inject an entry. It expects to be passed a title or a URL, or both. If only a URL is passed, Flexget attempts to find a suitable title from the response headers when that URL is requested. If even after this no title was found, the command will abort.

### Arguments
| argument | description |
| --- | --- |
| `title/url` | title or url of the entry to inject |
| `url` | url of the entry to inject |
| `--force` | prevent any plugins from rejecting this entry |
| `--accept` | accept this entry immediately upon injection
| `--fields NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]` | |

### Execute arguments
If only a URL and no title is given, Flexget will attempt to find a title in the URL's response headers.
