== Prerequisites ==

Let's make sure you have necessary software installed.

=== Python ===

!FlexGet requires Python 2.7, 3.3 or newer to run. You can check your version with command.

{{{
python -V
}}}

Example in Debian based system:

{{{
sudo apt-get install python3.5
}}}

Example in Arch based system:

{{{
sudo pacman -S python2
}}}

'''Note:''' Deluge doesn't support Python 3.x yet. Stick with Python 2.7 if you plan to use it.

=== PIP ===

Second piece of required software is python package manager called PIP. This can be usually found from operating system package repository under name `python-pip` or `python3-pip`. If you install `python3-pip` it may need to be used via command `pip-3.5` or something similar.

Example in Debian based system:

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}

Example in Arch based system:

{{{
sudo pacman -S python2-pip
}}}

== Upgrade setuptools ==

Using latest setuptools will save headaches in some older installations, this can be achieved with.

{{{
sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
}}}

== Install in a virtualenv ==

This is the recommended way unless you want multiple accounts in the system to be able to use !FlexGet without each having to install it themselves.

=== Install virtualenv ===

{{{
sudo pip install virtualenv
}}}

=== Create virtualenv ===

This creates isolated python environment. You can create as many of these as you like for each python application you use.

{{{
virtualenv ~/flexget/
}}}

'''Note:'''  if you plan to use the [wiki:Plugins/deluge deluge] plugin, you need to build your virtualenv with the --system-site-packages option.

{{{
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/flexget/
}}}

=== Install !FlexGet in the virtualenv ===

{{{
cd ~/flexget/
bin/pip install flexget
}}}

This will install !FlexGet and all dependencies.

=== Running !FlexGet from the virtualenv ===

Virtualenv can be activated with command:

{{{
source ~/flexget/bin/activate
}}}

After activation command `flexget` will work from anywhere. Note that activation does not persist over to new shell sessions.

Alternatively you can use following command without activating virtualenv.

{{{
~/flexget/bin/flexget [options]
}}}

You will need to use this form if you use crontab to schedule !FlexGet executions.

== Install globally ==

Global install for all users can be achieved with the following command.

{{{
sudo pip install flexget
}}}

This works fine usually, but on some cases you may run into issues if multiple python packages request different versions of libraries. Virtualenv does not suffer from this issue.
