## synocommunity
The synocommunity repository [https://synocommunity.com/](/https://synocommunity.com/) includes a FlexGet package. If you are less comfortable with the command line, you will probably find this method easier. It may, however, be more difficult to maintain. You must also wait for the package maintainers to update the FlexGet package; with the above method, updates to FlexGet may be installed as soon as they are released.

Follow the homepage instructions to add synocommunity to your NAS, and then install Python and FlexGet through the web interface. The config file will be available at `/usr/local/flexget/var/config.yml`.
