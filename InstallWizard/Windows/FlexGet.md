If you do not have python scripts directory in your [PATH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#System_path_variables) you will 
need to use full path for commands 
`pip` and `flexget`. Otherwise you will just get command not found complaint.

### Install

Go to `Start Menu` &rarr; `Accessories` &rarr; `Command Prompt` and run it as administrator.

Type this command in the command prompt. 
```cmd
pip install flexget
```

This will install FlexGet and all additional components it requires.

### Verify installation
Run command on prompt (cmd):

```cmd
flexget -V
```
