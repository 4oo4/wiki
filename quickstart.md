# Quickstart

The idea is to enable a quicker way for new users to create a rudimentry config via an interactive prompt.  
By asking the user for a few basic questions, we can build a task (or maybe more?) that will suffice as an entry level to flexget.

## Design

Core functionality should be separated from actual usage in order to easily apply this to both CLI and WEBUI, as it will be relevant in both.
