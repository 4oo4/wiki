= FlexWeb Concept
(Felt the need to separate this from the prior work that stevezau has done for the Web UI branded stuff untill we are sure that our ideas align.)
== Introduction
Ever since I started using Flexget I’ve loved the power and flexibility of it. At that same time I’ve never really felt completely comfortable with the configurations of it. The cookbook helped alot but in the end alot of the struggles of trying to get Flexget to behave as I want came from the great help in #FlexGet on IRC.

The power of editing the config to whatever your heart may desire still lives with me and I feel respect towards that. I’ve always believe that there is something more to be had if presented with the possibilities that a Web based UI provides. That the Web based UI should support and simplify for the core group of cli users but the focus of it might not be just giving a nice interface to the same functionality.

I believe that Flexget Web is an opportunity to explore interactions and service design from a semi-blank canvas, also offering the opportunity to improve flexget for a new subset of users.

== Getting the basics up and running
At the moment there are a few views related to managing config, execution or viewing history. I see these as a decent starting point to begin with something managable.

=== Base UI
The initial core features that the Flexget Web UI would like to have present.
At the current state I see this as:
* Login page
* Password manager
* Home page
* History
* Config editor (basic, more advanced later)
* Log file viewer
* Database editor

This should give a base set of tools that will be a good foundation for current users, and where most of them should be useful to keep in the larger picture.

== FlexWeb (early working name for differentiation)
This would be the longer term goal in creating a Web Experience focused on user needs from a pure web perspective, abstracted from the cli / config interface past.

=== Concept Background
Abstracted from what lies beneath. I see the majority of Flexget users using the product to manage aquisition of TV Series and Movies (with some fringe cases using it for other sources such as comics etc.). Abstract these to the pure needs and things start getting interesting and more creative.

Examples of such abstracted needs would be similar to:
* I want to be able to follow a list of series from a certain point.
* I want to be able to add movies to a download queue.
* I want to be able to import my series progress from an external source.

Working with a set of rules similar to this abstracts us from the set way of thought of the cli side of things and allows us to work on what would make a great user experience.

=== Concept Work

==== In progress
* General Brainstorming / Mind map of possible features.
* General Wireframing of a rough draft layout, with near term and long term concepts mapped.

==== Planned
* Prioritization of features.
* Sketches of prioritized views.
* Preliminary StyleTile/Visual look and feel.
* Designed prototypes of select views.
