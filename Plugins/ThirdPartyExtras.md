# Third-Party and Extra Plugins
These are plugins that are made by third parties, not common, actively maintained or are otherwise unsuitable for main distribution.

If you wish to add your plugin to this list, please edit this page and add a new row in the "Third-Party Plugins" table. The template for a plugin wiki page is found [here](/Site/ThirdPartyPluginTemplate). Your plugin's wiki page should be located under `/Plugins` on this site. For example, `/Plugins/my_plugin`. `my_plugin` must correspond to your plugin's name as it is used in the config file.

### Third-Party Plugins
Refer to the wiki page for download link and installation instructions.
