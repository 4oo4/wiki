This plugin can be used as a search or an input plugin for getting results from [https://www.t411.in/ Torrent411].

== Configuration ==
=== Setting your account ===
The plugin needs your credentials for working. Use the CLI for setting these:
{{{
flexget t411 auth-add <username> <password>
}}}

=== Schema ===
You must specify at least a category and use optionnals {{{terms}}} and/or {{{max_results}}}.
{{{
t411:
  category: <category name>
  terms:
    - <begin of term name>
  max_results: 100 (default)
}}}

You can list all available categories or sub-categories of one with the CLI:
{{{
flexget t411 list-cats
flexget t411 list-cats eBook
}}}

You can list all available terms, available terms of a category or terms of a (implemented soon) type of terms:
{{{
flexget t411 list-terms
flexget t411 list-terms --category Livres
flexget t411 list-terms --type Langue
}}}

Notice your configuration file does not have to include the full name of an end but only the beginning. Thus, {{{HDrip 1080 [Rip HD depuis Bluray]}}} may have written {{{HDrip 1080}}}.
