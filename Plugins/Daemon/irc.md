== IRC ==
This plugin will allow you to connect an "autodl" bot to an IRC channel. It listens for release announcements, parses them and sends them to the FlexGet daemon, which executes a task of your choosing with the input from IRC.
It's a somewhat complex plugin and difficult to test without access to the various trackers.

Unlike web crawling like most other search plugins, the bot will instead await torrent announcements in the given IRC channel(s), and will instantly pick any new releases up almost immediately. This benefits both the torrent sites and yourself.

=== Prerequisites ===
* Run Flexget in daemon-mode. (ex: ''flexget daemon start --daemonize''). This means you may want to migrate your cron-jobs to use the scheduler plugin instead.
* irc python package (ex: ''pip install irc'')
* Have a autodl-tracker file relevant to your intended tracker, downloaded from [https://github.com/autodl-community/autodl-trackers here].
* rsskey or other needed credentials located in the tracker file and in the guide sections in your tracker website. (hint: look for autodl guides)

=== Example config ===
{{{
irc:
  irc_cool_tracker:
    tracker_file: '/absolute/path/to/trackerfile'
    nickname: 'qvazzler_autodl' #make sure to check naming conventions before joining
    nickserv_password: '{{ secrets.irc.nickserv_password }}'
    port: 7011
    rsskey: '{{ secrets.irc.rsskey }}'
    task: get_entry
    channels: ["#ctannounces"]
  irc_some_other_tracker:
    tracker_file: '/absolute/path/to/a/different/trackerfile'
    nickname: 'qvazzler-bot' #make sure to check naming conventions, this one is different
    nickserv_password: '{{ secrets.other_irc.nickserv_password }}'
    port: 6667
    passkey: '{{ secrets.other_irc.passkey }}'
    task_re:
      some_other_entry_get_task:
        - regexp: (TV\/x265)|(TV\/x264)|(TV\/Web-DL)
          field: irc_category #continuation, no dash on this line!
    channels: ["#sot.announce"]

tasks:
  #Passed into this task with very few fields available, including title, download url, and the fields from the tracker file..
  get_entry:
    metainfo_series: yes
    #trakt_lookup: yes #do I need this?
    disable: seen
    if:
      - irc_category in ['Movies', 'TV/HD', 'TV/SD']: accept
    template: download-it #download anything matching the categories specified in this task

  some_other_entry_get_task:
    metainfo_series: yes
    disable: seen
    template: download-it #download anything passed down by the irc plugin (already filtered on category)
}}}

=== task vs task_re ===
The task_re option allows you to have for example 2 tasks, one for movies and one for shows. Since the categories are filtered already in the irc plugin, you can be sure to pass only movie entries to your get_movie task and series entries to your get_series tasks.

task gets the job done too in most cases, but ideally you'd want to go with task_re.

The categories are different for each tracker (maybe not even called irc_category, check the tracker file!), but usually the match the category names on their website. You could also just monitor the announcements made in their IRC to understand the pattern.

=== Known Issues ===
* May fail to reconnect under certain conditions or crash. Should be worked out now that the irc daemon restarts the connection after a very short period.

=== Tips ===
* Fields in the tracker file for you to use if/regex with in the task are prefixed with {{{ irc_ }}}. Example: {{{ irc_category }}}
* Passkey, rsskey, user, uid, the fields you need to specify all vary depending on the tracker, not do they originate from the irc daemon. Pay extremely close attention to the trackerfile.
* If you are using multiple configs, you'll need to use daemon on all of them, then combine exec, some bash scripting, web ui and web api to distribute the announce event to the different flexget daemons running diff. configs.
* It is _technically_ possible to run this without a tracker file, but then you'd lose the irc_ prefixed fields. If the message is more than an URL, be prepared to use the manipulate plugin.
* cvium is still accepting bug reports, easiest would be to go to our [https://gitter.im/Flexget/Flexget IRC channel]. This functionality should still be considered experimental.
